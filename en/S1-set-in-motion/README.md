# S01 — Set in motion

This season is an ignition. Not theory first, but a transition: from claim to observation.

Here, the collection takes a step away from certainty. Language begins to move: “is” becomes “at this point it looks like this.” Thought doesn’t soften — it sharpens. When a claim stops being a lock, it becomes a tool.

If later seasons build structures (mind–body, time, emergence, Möbius), this one first practices the skill that makes them visible at all: tolerating incompleteness without losing meaning.

## Episodes

- **E01 — From claim to observation**
- **E02 — On science and philosophy so far**
- **E03 — From a random thought to consciousness**

## How to read this season

- If you want a key to the whole collection, start with **E01**.
- If you want the frame and the thesis, **E02** sketches the background (science–philosophy).
- If you want a quick hook, **E03** jumps from everyday life straight into questions of consciousness.
