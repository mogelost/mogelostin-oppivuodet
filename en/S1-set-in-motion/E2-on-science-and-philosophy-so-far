# On science and philosophy so far

Science and philosophy have traditionally been inseparable companions. From the natural philosophers of antiquity onward, understanding the world has required a union of empiricism and thought. As late as the seventeenth century, the greatest scientific minds—Isaac Newton among them—still regarded themselves as *natural philosophers*. Newton’s famous image of standing on the shoulders of giants captures how new discoveries are built on the work of earlier thinkers.

In recent times, however, the relationship has drifted into crisis. Some contemporary physicists have gone so far as to claim that philosophy is dead—an empty and useless discipline beside science. One world-famous physicist declared philosophy obsolete on the grounds that it had supposedly failed to keep pace with developments in physics. A popular science communicator, in turn, dismissed philosophy as a waste of time that serious researchers should avoid.

Paradoxically, such statements are themselves philosophical claims about the nature of knowledge—proof that philosophy cannot be escaped even by those who disparage it. The widening rift also shows up at the opposite extreme: a postmodern sensitivity to relativity has pushed parts of contemporary philosophy so far that even the ideas of truth and objectivity are reduced to mere matters of perspective. This has fed anti-scientific attitudes and blurred the sense of why science is a uniquely reliable way of acquiring knowledge.

This work argues that reuniting science and philosophy is necessary if we are to reach the next major step in humanity’s thinking. The aim is to build a new kind of bridge between empiricism and rational reflection: standing on the shoulders of earlier giants, but with our gaze fixed on more distant horizons still. By combining scientific and philosophical approaches, we can move beyond today’s limits and raise both our understanding and our consciousness to a new level.

## Shared roots of science and philosophy

Science and philosophy share a common origin. Ancient Greek thinkers—Aristotle among them—studied nature as part of philosophy; there was not yet any separate “science” in the modern sense. Natural philosophy encompassed everything from explaining phenomena in the world to ethics and metaphysics.

Even at the dawn of the modern era, scientists were philosophers. Galileo defended the heliocentric worldview not only with telescopic observations but also with philosophical arguments, and Newton titled his principal work *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* to emphasize its philosophical dimension.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientific fields began to differentiate into distinct specialties, yet the basic premises of scientific inquiry were still shaped by philosophers. Francis Bacon outlined the foundations of empiricism and the modern scientific method, warning researchers about deceptive “idols”—distortions of the human mind that can bias observation. Immanuel Kant, for his part, analyzed the possibilities and limits of reason, cautioning against groundless speculation beyond the domain of phenomena.

Insights like these guided the development of science. Karl Popper’s principle of falsifiability—the idea that a theory must be, in principle, refutable—is a philosophical criterion that became a cornerstone of scientific method.

Historical examples show that scientific breakthroughs have often depended on philosophical reflection. Einstein observed—aptly—that familiarity with historical and philosophical background gives a researcher independence from the prejudices of their own generation, and that this philosophical perspective is what distinguishes a genuine seeker of truth from a mere technician specialized in narrow skills.

Science has always contained questions that arise from philosophy: What are time and space? What can we know with certainty? What separates science from pseudoscience? Without grappling with such questions, science would not have advanced to its present level.

## The age of separation and its problems

Over the past centuries, the stunning specialization and success of science have created the impression that philosophy is no longer needed alongside it. In the late twentieth century, the view gained ground that science solves concrete problems while philosophy is left as an academic pastime. Under this way of thinking, many researchers were trained to run experiments and calculations without a broader philosophical frame. A gap opened between the “hard” natural sciences and the “soft” humanities.

The consequences of that gap show up in sharpened attitudes. Some leading figures in the natural sciences have publicly argued that philosophy has nothing left to offer—that it is dead weight from the past. Students have been urged to keep their distance from philosophy’s “pointless” musings in the name of practical science.

This scientistic posture—the belief that experimental data collection alone is enough—denies a basic fact: scientific thinking itself depends on philosophical assumptions (for example, the regularity of nature, the existence of causal relations, and the theory-laden character of observation). Without conscious philosophical self-understanding, a researcher may slip into mistaken assumptions without noticing.

It is no accident that those who dismiss philosophy sometimes run into trouble in their own theories: they may propose hypotheses that can never be empirically tested or falsified, pushing their work beyond the boundaries of science. As an example, some fashionable contemporary frameworks (such as string-theoretic visions extending into vast numbers of dimensions) posit entities or dimensions for which observation is, in principle, impossible. If a theory does not meet Popper’s criterion of falsifiability, it risks drifting toward the borderlands of pseudoscience.

From the other direction, philosophy’s detachment from science has led parts of philosophical discussion away from reality. Extreme relativists have claimed that scientific knowledge has no special status, that every account of the world is merely a product of power and discourse. Such a view denies the difference between science and opinion and threatens to erase the very basis of rational discussion. It also feeds a climate in which, for instance, opponents of vaccines or deniers of climate science can say: “it’s just one narrative among others.”

In this way, the misuse of philosophy to undermine the value of science becomes the flip side of the same coin by which parts of the scientific community belittle philosophy. Both extremes—science without philosophy, and philosophy without science—are harmful to the search for truth.

In summary, the separation of science and philosophy has produced a situation in which each struggles with its own blind spots. Science without philosophy endangers its foundations and its direction; philosophy without science risks losing its subject matter and its grip on the concrete. What is needed is a corrective movement—one that restores dialogue between the two.

## Toward a new integrative paradigm

It is becoming increasingly clear that the next paradigm in the development of science requires a reunion of science and philosophy. As Thomas Kuhn described, scientific revolutions occur when a prevailing model of thought becomes incompatible with emerging phenomena, opening the way for a new framework—different at the level of its foundations. We are now at precisely such a point of rupture.

A new paradigm does not abandon the scientific method; it expands its scope and deepens its self-awareness. It rests on several key principles:

- **A holistic view of knowledge:** The natural sciences, the human sciences, and philosophy are seen as a continuous expression of the same hunger to know, rather than as strictly separated compartments. Individual trees must not prevent us from seeing the forest.
- **Attention to consciousness and subjective experience:** The new paradigm broadens the domain of science to include qualitative dimensions of human experience—consciousness, lived experience, and meaning.
- **Integration of scientific and philosophical methods:** Empirical observation and experimentation are joined with deep theoretical reflection. Hypotheses arise not only from data, but also from creative thinking and thought experiments.
- **Historical and philosophical self-awareness:** Knowledge of the history and philosophy of science provides protection against groupthink and intellectual fashions.
- **Balance between realism and relativism:** We reject both the delusion of science’s omnipotence and extreme relativism: the world is real and knowable, but our theories are models with limits.

These principles are not empty ideals; they are practical guidelines for everyday research. Interdisciplinary teams in which natural scientists and philosophers work together (for example in consciousness research or in ethical questions around AI) already embody these principles. At its core this is a matter of science reflecting on itself—asking after its own grounds and aims, with philosophy as an ally.

## Conclusions and a glance toward the future

A renewed convergence of science and philosophy promises significant benefits both for the scientific community and for humanity at large. First, it offers tools for addressing science’s own hardest problems: questions about the nature of consciousness, the singularity of the Big Bang, or the interpretation of quantum physics will not be resolved by equations and measurements alone; they also demand philosophical insight.

Second, an integrative approach can accelerate innovation in ways we cannot yet predict. When imagination is coupled to rigorous scientific thought, it creates fertile ground for new theories and inventions.

Third, the alliance of science and philosophy deepens our understanding of what science means for human society. Science is not value-free tinkering; it shapes our worldview and influences how we understand our own place in the world. Bringing philosophy back into the picture helps ensure that rapidly advancing technologies—such as AI, gene editing, or climate technologies—serve ends that are genuinely humanly worthwhile.

It is worth noting that an integrative paradigm does not belittle previous achievements—on the contrary, it acknowledges its debt to earlier generations of scientists and philosophers. “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” Newton wrote, with characteristic modesty.

Finally, it is fitting to say, plainly and humbly, that a great thinker recognizes their own position before truth. This new direction, too, will in time be exposed to criticism and scrutiny. And so it should be—for only in that way does knowledge develop.

By joining forces, science and philosophy can help us pursue truth more holistically. Together they offer both facts and meaning: explanations of how the world works, and understanding of why it matters to us at all. The question posed at the outset was whether the union of philosophy and science can raise humanity to its next level. The answer is: it can—if we are courageous enough to break the artificial borders within our thinking.
